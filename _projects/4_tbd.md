<p>Hi! I'm Raman, and I'm thrilled to be your CS6120 Teaching Assistant for the semester. I'm in my final semester MSCS general student. My research interests include Generative AI, Natural Language Processing, and Knowledge Graphs. I’m passionate about leveraging AI technologies to solve real-world problems.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computing from Delhi Technological University and gained industry experience through internships at Experian and Amazon. I’ve also participated in hackathons, developing innovative solutions like a codebase query system that won an Experian internal competition. My ultimate goal is to contribute to cutting-edge AI research and its applications in software engineering.
