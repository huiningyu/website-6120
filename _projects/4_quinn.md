Hi! I'm Quinn Gao, your CS6120 TA this semester and a third‑semester MSCS student at Northeastern. I'm exploring Generative AI, NLP, and Cybersecurity these days, and I originally majored in Physics at Beijing Normal University.

When I'm not coding, I like to read novels or play video games because they help me power up for late‑night vibe‑coding sessions. You're always welcome to swing by office hours if you need help with algorithms, stubborn bugs, or just want to swap book and game recommendations between writing code.

### A Little More About Myself

I have started learning Japanese as a side hobby, and I'm still at the early stage of daily conversations with the help of watching anime XD. Since last semester I've been picking up the piano, spending a few minutes each day on finger exercises, scales and beginner pieces like Für Elise. Aside from these hobbies, I'm active on Chinese Wikipedia as a gadget developer, so if you happen to know me, feel free to connect with me!
